Hi there,

Welcome to my optimization project.

The optimizations that I have made include:

• Css minimize and inlined.

• Stopped render blocking using async javaScript and moving to bottom of page.

• Forced css classes to new layers to speed up animations.

TO DO:

• Optimize JavaScript to stop thrashing (lines 280 - 315).
  • Fix rating circle shading now working.

• Multithreaded worker processing to speed up load time?
